Client:
    ☐ The client should be able to handle afl
        Later down the road has to have more options for other fuzzers
    ☐ Recieve fuzzjobs
        ☐ handle all the fuzzing requests
    ☐ Send queues and crashes to the server
        crashes are possibly included in the queue as well?
        ☐ get all files
        ☐ base64 encode them
        ☐ send them to the server
    ☐ write a webfrontend that displays statistics of the running fuzzers of the client

Server:
    ☐ For now automatically send a few fuzz jobs to the client
    ☐ Seperate the types package into types and globals
    ☐ write a webfrontend that can manage the clients
        for statistics it should redirect to the fuzzing instance itself
